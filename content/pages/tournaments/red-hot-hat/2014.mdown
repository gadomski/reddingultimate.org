The 2014 Red Hot Hat tournament will be held on Saturday, May 3rd at [Enterprise Park](/places/enterprise), starting at 8:30am.
<a href="https://docs.google.com/a/reddingultimate.org/forms/d/1t6qrCJyXYwWvuOvxA3npEJ7ciLlaS8VaI7zMXEJ9lTU/viewform" target="_blank">Pre-registration</a> is $20. Day-of registration is also $20, but we'd appreciate the use of our pre-registation form.  We hope to see you there!

The Red Hot Hat is an open-to-the-public hat tournament.
You don't need to come with a team &mdash; just bring yourself, and we will put together random yet balanced teams the morning of the tournament!
The tournament starts at 8:30am and will run through the afternoon until 4pm or 5pm.

We will provide a guaranteed four games, food, hydration, and basic amenities.
Pre-registration <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/reddingultimate.org/forms/d/1t6qrCJyXYwWvuOvxA3npEJ7ciLlaS8VaI7zMXEJ9lTU/viewform" target="_blank">is open</a> (link will open in a new window), and you will be presented with a link to pay after you submit the form.
You're welcome to indicate your intention to attend on the [Facebook event](https://www.facebook.com/events/249867791868063/?ref=br_tf), but you will *not* be registered unless you complete our registration form and pay.

All updates and new information will be posted to this page, as well as our [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/ReddingUltimateAssociation/) and [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/redding-ultimate-association).
We can't wait to see you at the tournament on May 3rd!

Some miscellany:

* In celebration of our 4th annual Red Hot Hat, this year's theme is Red Hot Planet being that Mars is the 4th planet from the sun. Each team will be themed after a different space/Martian idea.
* We will have discs available for purchase at the fields for $10. Each disc is uniquely designed and custom painted by our very own James O'Connell.
* Even if you pre-register, you will need to sign a waiver when you get to the fields. If you are under 18, you will need a parent or guardian present to sign the waiver with you.
* While we encourage revelry and good times in every form, alcohol is not allowed at the fields.
